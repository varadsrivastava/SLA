## Introduction
Education plays a vital role in the overall development of the country. It not only contributes to the socio-economic growth but also help the country step closer to its dream of an egalitarian society. With flagship programs such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the government has introduced provisions of judicious quality elementary education for all. However, people with special needs face difficulties in availing the opportunities accessible to them. To facilitate them, a SLA (Smart Learning Assistant) tool is envisaged which can cater to their specific needs in the classroom teaching and hence can empower them to play a vital role in the overall nation building. Many commercial products are available in the market for assistance of the differently abled but, these products are operative on devices like laptops and smart phones which are often very costly and are beyond the reach of major section of the society. Usage of laptops furthermore makes these products very bulky for the differently abled.
In this effort, a cost-effective SLA tool supported by Android Platform is proposed to appease the needs of visual, hearing or speech impaired students.

## Raitonale
The world is an ever-growing place and each of its seven billion inhabitants are not equal. The aim of this project is to provide assistance to hearing, visual and speech impaired students so that they can efficiently make use of the various teaching-learning opportunities in the classroom offered to them. A tool called SLA tool is envisioned which will work on Android Platform using Raspberry pi, a single board computer. Open Source Software will be utilised as these are customizable and will help to reduce the cost of the tool. It will benefit not only the targeted students but also the student development team as it is a multi- disciplinary endeavour which involves documentation, circuit design, programming, integration of various modules and components.

## Objective
The primary objective of the project is to develop a cost-effective and light weight tool using sensors supported by Android Platform to conciliate the needs of visual, hearing and speech impaired students. The SLA tool will also provide such students with the medium to communicate and comprehend what is being taught in the class room.

## Methodology
To achieve the aforementioned objectives, SLA tool will be developed that will facilitate the students with visual, hearing and vocal impairments. The tool will have separate modules for performing the above functions. It will have a screen and a menu driven GUI that will be developed on the Android Platform integrated with Raspberry pi.

- For visually impaired students, the tool will feature physical buttons inscribed with Braille text. The text on the board would be converted into braille or audio according to student’s choice.
- For hearing impaired, the voice commands will be converted to text with the help of an applet which will send speech to the micro-controller via serial communication over Bluetooth.
-	For vocally or speech impaired students, the tool will be equipped with the sensors that detect gestures and will convert these into the text and speech.
 
Provision for recognition of voice commands and performance of action, will also be provided by playing back voice tracks stored on its memory. The tool will be supported with the tutorials to help the students understand the its effective usage. The tutorials will be made available both in the form of audios and visuals clips on the screen.  Efforts will be made to make the tool compatible with existing tools available on web.
